To create a simple application that hosts a folder using Python's built-in `http.server` module and allows file sharing among devices on the same WiFi network, you can use the Flask framework. Flask provides a convenient way to create web applications in Python.\n\nHere's a basic example:\n\n1. First, install Flask if you haven't already. Open a terminal and run:\n   ```\n   pip install Flask\n   ```\n\n2. Create a file named `app.py` with the following content:\n\n   ```python\n   from flask import Flask, render_template, send_from_directory\n   import socket\n   import os\n\n   app = Flask(__name__)\n\n   @app.route('/')\n   def index():\n       return render_template('index.html')\n\n   @app.route('/files/<path:filename>')\n   def download_file(filename):\n       return send_from_directory('shared_folder', filename)\n\n   if __name__ == '__main__':\n       host_ip = socket.gethostbyname(socket.gethostname())\n       shared_folder_path = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), 'shared_folder')\n\n       if not os.path.exists(shared_folder_path):\n           os.makedirs(shared_folder_path)\n\n       print(f\"Server running on http://{host_ip}:5000/\")\n       app.run(host=host_ip, port=5000, debug=True)\n   ```\n\n3. Create a folder named `templates` in the same directory as `app.py`. Inside the `templates` folder, create a file named `index.html` with the following content:\n\n   ```html\n   <!DOCTYPE html>\n   <html lang=\"en\">\n   <head>\n       <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n       <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n       <title>File Sharing App</title>\n   </head>\n   <body>\n       <h1>File Sharing App</h1>\n       <p>Access shared files from this link: <a href=\"/files/\" target=\"_blank\">Shared Files</a></p>\n   </body>\n   </html>\n   ```\n\n4. Run the application by executing the following command in the terminal:\n\n   ```\n   python app.py\n   ```\n\n   The server will start, and you can access the shared files through the link provided in the console, such as `http://<your_ip_address>:5000/files/`.\n\nPlace the files you want to share in the `shared_folder` directory, and others on the same WiFi network can access them using the link provided by your server.\n\nNote: Make sure your firewall allows incoming connections to the specified port (default is 5000), and replace `<your_ip_address>` with the actual IP address of the hosting machine on the local network."
